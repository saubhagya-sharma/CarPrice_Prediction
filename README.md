# CarPrice_Prediction
This project focusses on creating a machine learning model which can accurately predict the price of cars on the basis of multiple factors ranging from Kms run to fuel type. The models in focus of the project are Linear Regression model and Lasso Regression Model. The dataset used in this project is available in the repository or you can check it out on kaggle by the link provided in the description of the dataset file that I uploaded.
